# About Me

In the last 10 years I’ve worked mostly for MSP and MSSP companies. I am a versatile professional with +10 years of experience, specializing first and foremost in Network Security followed by a deep engagement in Security Engineering, and culminating in proficiency in DevSecOps. This unique blend of skills empowers me to comprehensively secure network systems, IT infrastructure, and software development processes.

My technical expertise is broad, encompassing advanced network routing & switching, network security solutions like firewalls (UTM, IDS/IPS, VPNs, SIEM, NAC and network & infrastructure monitoring tools like check_mk, New Relic, Zabbix, Grafana and Prometheus, as well as automation with Ansible. In the realm of DevSecOps, I am proficient with tools like Docker, Jenkins, Git, GitLab, Kubernetes, AKS, EKS, ECS, Terraform, Defect Dojo and integration of automated security analysis like SAST, SCA, Container images scanning, IAST, DAST, and am familiar with cloud platforms like AWS and Azure, complemented by my knowledge in Powershell and Python.

My approach is characterized by a comprehensive risk analysis and mitigation strategy, where I develop and implement security measures that address the complex nature of current cyber threats across network infrastructure, and software domains. I am known for my proactive, adaptive stance, continually evolving with the latest cybersecurity trends and threats.

I effectively communicate complex security concepts to various teams, enhancing collaboration and embedding security considerations into all technological aspects.
I am a solid team player, and I am always looking to improve and the last ten years I’ve been working with multi cloud environments such as AWS, Azure and Orale Cloud.
